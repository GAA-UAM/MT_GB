# Multi-Task Gradient Boosting

This repository contains the code and implementation for the paper "Multi-Task Gradient Boosting".



## Usage

The code for the proposed algorithm is available in this repository for multi-task regression and classification problems. The code is implemented in Python and uses the scikit-learn library.

To run the code, clone this repository and install the necessary libraries. Then, run the `mtgb.py` file to train and test the multi-task gradient boosting algorithm on the provided datasets.



## Contributing

Contributions to the code and implementation are welcome. Please fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes.
